# Randomized experiments

## Review: Core elements of a randomized experiment

-   You have a treatment.

-   *You randomly assign treatment to units.*

-   You compare the outcomes for the units that were assigned to treatment to outcomes for those that were not.

## What can you learn from an experiment?

The *average causal effect* of the treatment $T$ on an outcome $Y$ for the units that you have in your study.

-   You have to clearly define what the treatment means and what it means to not have the treatment.

-   The units in your study might or might not be representative of a larger population.

## What do we mean by "$T$ causes $Y$"?

-   We're going to take the counterfactual approach.

-   "$T$ causes $Y$" is a claim about what didn't happen.

    -   "If $T$ had not occurred, then $Y$ would not have occurred."

    -   "With $T$, the probability of $Y$ is higher than would be without $T$."

-   "$T$ causes $Y$" requires a *context*

    -   Matches cause flame but require oxygen.

    -   Small classrooms improve test scores but require experienced teachers and funding.

-   "$T$ causes $Y$" doesn't mean "$W$ does not cause $Y$."

# How can we learn the average causal effect from an experiment?


## We have 12 units

![](images/fig01-units.png)

## $Y_i(1)$, the outcome each unit would have if treated

![](images/fig02-Y1.png)


## $Y_i(0)$, the outcome each unit would have if not treated

![](images/fig03-Y0.png)

## Each unit has both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$

![](images/fig02-Y1.png){width="220"}![](images/fig03-Y0.png){width="220"}

## So each unit has a treatment effect $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$

![](images/fig04-tau.png)
## Potential outcomes

-   For each unit we assume that there are two *post-treatment* outcomes: $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$.

-   $Y_i(1)$ is the outcome that *would* obtain *if* the unit received the treatment ($T_i=1$).

-   $Y_i(0)$ is the outcome that *would* obtain *if* the unit received the control ($T_i=0$).

## The *causal effect* of treatment is $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$

<!-- 1.  This doesn't make sense without defining what it means to not have $T$. -->

1.  Each individual unit $i$ has its own causal effect $\tau_i$.

2.  But we can't measure the individual-level causal effect, because we can't observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ at the same time. This is known as the *fundamental problem of causal inference*.


## Let's go back to the $Y_i(1)$

![](images/fig05-Y1.png)

## We can take a random sample of these $Y_i(1)$

![](images/fig06-y1-sample1.png)

## We can take another random sample of these $Y_i(1)$

![](images/fig07-y1-sample2.png)

## And another!

![](images/fig08-y1-sample3.png)

## Let's get back to the $Y_i(0)$

![](images/fig09-y0-novals.png)

## And we can take a random sample of these $Y_i(0)$

![](images/fig10-y0-sample1.png)

## A random assignment

![](images/fig06-y1-sample1.png){width="220"}![](images/fig10-y0-sample1.png){width="220"}


## Put them together

## A different random assignment

## Randomization is powerful

-   Randomization creates groups that are similar except that one will receive the treatment and the other will not.

-   So when we compare the two groups after one has received treatment, we can attribute the difference to (1) the effect of the treatment and (2) chance.

    <!-- -   We want to design randomized experiments that give us confidence that differences are not just due to chance. -->

-   Without randomization, it's hard to tell whether differences in the outcome are due to (1) treatment or (2) some other factor correlated with it.

## Let's be more precise about randomization

-   It doesn't mean haphazard or having no control!

-   Randomization means that every observation has a known probability of assignment to experimental conditions *between* 0 and 1.

    -   No unit in the experimental sample is assigned to treatment with certainty (probability = 1) or to control with certainty (probability = 0).


## Core assumptions

We need to make sure we don't violate two core assumptions behind our theoretical infrastructure as we design our randomized experiments:

-   Excludability.

-   Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).

## Core assumption 1: SUTVA, part 1

1.  No interference -- A subject's potential outcome reflects only whether that subject receives the treatment himself/herself. It is not affected by how treatments happen to be allocated to other subjects.

    -   A classic violation is the case of vaccines and their spillover effects.

    -   Say I am in the control condition (no vaccine). If whether I get sick ($Y_i(0)$) depends on other people's treatment status (whether they take the vaccine), it's like I have two different $Y_i(0)$!

## Core assumption 1: SUTVA, part 2

2.  No hidden variations of the treatment

    -   Say treatment is taking a vaccine, but there are two kinds of vaccines and they have different ingredients.

    -   An example of a violation is when whether I get sick when I take the vaccine ($Y_i(1)$) depends on which vaccine I take. We would have two different $Y_i(1)$!

## Core assumption 2: Excludability

-   Treatment assignment has no effect on outcomes except through its effect on whether treatment was received.

    -   Important to define receiving treatment precisely.

    -   Treatment and control groups should be treated the same, except for the actual treatment.

# Randomized experiments vs observational studies

## Different types of studies

-   Randomized studies

    -   Randomize treatment, then go measure outcomes.

    -   We can attribute differences in outcomes to the treatment (plus noise).

-   Observational studies

    -   Treatment is not randomly assigned. It is observed, but not manipulated.

    -   Differences might be due to underlying differences (selection bias) or the treatment (plus noise). It's often very hard to tell.

## What is the advantage of randomization?

-   If the intervention is randomized, then who receives or doesn't receive the intervention is not related to the characteristics of the potential recipients.

-   With randomization, those who were randomly selected to not receive the intervention are good stand-ins for the counterfactuals for those who were randomly selected to receive the treatment, and vice versa.

-   This is not assured in observational studies.

## Internal validity

-   Randomized studies have high internal validity -- confidence that we have learned the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome.

-   An advantage over observational studies that have to invoke other strong assumptions to make the same claim.

    <!-- -   Causal estimates from regression analyses aren't guaranteed to weight all units equally. -->

## Generalizability 

-   The finding from a particular study in one particular place and at one particular time may not hold in other settings (i.e., not have external validity).

-   This is a general concern for observational studies as well, not just a concern for randomized studies.

    -   [EGAP's Metaketa Initiative](https://egap.org/our-work/the-metaketa-initiative/) works to accumulate knowledge by pre-planning a meta-analysis of multiple studies that have high internal validity due to randomization.
