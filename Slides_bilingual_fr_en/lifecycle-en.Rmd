## Key points for this lecture \| *Points clés du cours*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Find a design that is scientifically sound, cost-effective, ethical, and that is (maximimally) informative for decisionmakers 
- Build credibility in your design by registering a detailed plan first
- Things will happen that are not expected!  
- Report on what happened honestly, enable future researchers to confirm what you found and build on it

## Where to start \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

Who finds the idea:

- You
- Partner organization
- Funding sources 

\bigskip

Where the idea comes from:
 
- Reading literature (create gap map, replication)
- Interviews/participant observation with beneficiaries or partners
- Identify evidence gaps in practice

## Finding an implementer \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

A good implementing partner:

- Shares your learning goals
- Can work at the scale needed for power
- Has buy-in from relevant internal and external decisionmakers
- Ideally, has funds for implementation (and even measurement) or can help raise them

## Working with partners \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- What to do when partner goals conflict with scientific goals?
- Publication rights 
- Contribute to partner's decisionmaking

## Declare (define) your design \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Causal model (how you think it works)
- Specific research question 
- Randomization and measurement procedures
- Analysis procedure

## Assess your design \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- It it powered?
- Is your analysis procedure biased? (Analyze as your randomize!)
- Can you quantify uncertainty?
- Is it cost effective?
- Do benefits outweigh costs to participants?
- What are risks to participants, communities, research staff?

- Pilot funding
- Implementation funding
- Research funding 
  - National research agencies
  - National development agencies
  - JPAL, IPA
  - Philanthropies

## Scoping and piloting \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Is the intervention feasible?
- Is your measurement strategy feasible?
- What information/data do you need to carry out your experiment?
- Cannot learn much about the effect size! 
- Large pilots not worth it -- except as proof of concept

## Feedback \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Who: researchers, implementers, policymakers, and participants/beneficiaries 
- What: will the research provide (maximally) useful evidence? Is the study worth running?
- When: before scoping, before preanalysis plan, before analysis

## Preanalysis plans \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

Two risks to science: "p-hacking" and the "file drawer problem" \bigskip

Partial solution: register your study and how you plan to analyze it in advance

## File drawer problem \| *yy*

## What to include in a PAP \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Describe randomization, measurement, and analysis plans
- Use mock data to create mock tables and figures
- Power analysis

## Pivoting \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Things often don't go according to plan! 
- Go/no go decision
- Pivot to other questions, imperfect design for same questions

## Populated preanalysis plan \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

Dutifully follow the PAP 

\bigskip

Post on your website or public archive

## Reconciliation with PAP \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

Analyize as you randomize $\rightarrow$ changes

## Communicating \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

What you found, why it should be believed (design), and to whom/where the evidence applies

\bigskip 

Who are the consumers of your evidence, who might change their decisions based on it? Are you reaching them?

## Archiving \| *yy*

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.48\\textwidth}"}

- Share data, code to enable reproduction of results
- Share materials to enable replicating study (intervention details, survey questionnaires, etc.)
