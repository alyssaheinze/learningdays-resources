## The bibliography

We are using the `learningdays-guide.bib` file as our bibliography database. It
is a copy from the one in the [Learning Days Book
repository](https://github.com/egap/theory_and_practice_of_field_experiments/tree/main/Book)
If you make changes, let us know and we will sync them (by hand, currently)
with that file.
